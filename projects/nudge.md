I started this app as a way to help remind me to take periodic breaks from
sitting. However, this application is capable of practical time management tools
like Pomodoros and more!

This application's development is currently driven by features I learn that I
want while using it, so it is a project that keeps growing with time!

The rest of this write-up is a project for future me :)
