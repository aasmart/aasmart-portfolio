# My Corner of the Internet

## Welcome

Welcome to my website, and I hope you've liked what you've seen so far.
If not, please let me know what's going wrong. I'd love to fix it.
In any case, on to the content of this write-up.

## Goals of My Project Write Ups

When creating my website, I decided that I wanted to write little posts
about the projects I've worked on to. With them, I want to share my thought process
behind certain decisions, share cool things, have them as a time capsule, and
much more.

There's a lot more important things to as my website is in its infancy as of
writing this, but I hope to expand these to things like experiences in the
future to highlight the cool things I do in them.

## The Birth of this Website

I've tried to make a personal website in the past a couple times, but none of
the attempts were successful. I never really liked the theme I was going for
as it always felt too generic. Moreover, I would always spend way too long
perfecting every visual. This is largely because I put theme before function
with these websites. I still do, but to a lesser extent.

However, the core theme was still central to what I wanted to do, so I wanted
to iron that out first. As alluded to, this took me a while to come up with.
I wanted something that was different from what I've seen before, but
was still usable as a website for the general public. (a pure
terminal was out of the question ðŸ˜…). I played around with a few ideas that,
in theory, would involved over-the-top visuals to put everything together.
Yet, none of them fully resonated with me.

One evening I was trying to brainstorm website ideas. I was on the topic of
terminal-themed websites as I've seen a couple before. One was a mostly
non-interactive terminal, while the other was like a real terminal. I didn't
pure terminals as they may be unintuitive to some users, but the static one
was also boring. I suddenly had the spark of an idea: what if I put the
commands in the navigation bar, as well as having a real command input. I
quickly sketched some stuff out, and it felt like everything went together
nicely. So, I had my website... which I credit to just a few buttons.

## More coming soon...

I'm a busy person lol.
